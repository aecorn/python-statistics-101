### Samplics

ANOVAs, Pairwise post-hocs tests, robust, partial, distance and repeated measures correlations
Linear/logistic regression and mediation analysis, Bayes Factors, Multivariate tests
Reliability and consistency, Effect sizes and power analysis, Parametric/bootstrapped confidence intervals around an effect size or a correlation coefficient, Circular statistics, Chi-squared tests, Plotting: Bland-Altman plot, Q-Q plot, paired plot, robust correlation...
